# MessAuto

MessAuto is a macOS app that automatically extracts Email and SMS verification codes to pasteboard. It is 100% developed
with Rust and is suitable for any app. It is a free alternative to [2FHey](https://2fhey.com/).

The following GIF shows the process of completing SMS verification and login within ten seconds with the support of
MessAuto. After clicking the button, you only need to wait for about 5 seconds.

Features:

- Not just iMessage.app, but Mail.app too!
- Multi-language support: currently supports Chinese, English, and Korean; automatically switches based on the system
  language.
- Light-weight: the app occupies 4 M storage and 14 M memory.
- Concise: without GUI, only a quiet taskbar tray icon, but powerful.
- Wide applicability: the Safari plan can only be used in the Safari browser, and this app is suitable for any app.
- Open source and free: the fee-based plan [2FHey](https://2fhey.com/) requires at least $5.

## Usage

MessAuto is a menu bar app without GUI. When you launch it for the first time, MessAuto will pop up a window to guide
you to authorize full disk access permission.

After granting permission, you can see the MessAuto icon in the menu bar by restarting the app. Click the icon to list
the menu:

- Auto paste: MessAuto stores the detected verification code in your clipboard. If you don't want to paste it manually,
  you can enable this option. When this option is enabled, MessAuto will actively remind you to authorize the
  accessibility feature.
- Auto enter: one step further than auto paste. Only when auto paste is enabled, can auto enter be selected.
- Hide for now: temporarily hide the icon. The icon will reappear when the app is restarted, suitable for users who do
  not often restart the Mac.
- Hide forever: permanently hide the icon. Even if the app is restarted, the icon will not appear again. This is
  suitable for users who restart Mac frequently. If you need to show the icon again, you need to delete
  the `~/.config/messauto/messauto.json` file and restart the app.
- Launch at login: Nobody doesn't open it, right?
- Configuration: click on it will open a configuration file in json format, in which you can customize the keywords
- Listen email: turn on to listen to emails at the same time

> Keywords: also called trigger words, when the message contains keywords such as "verification code", the program will
> perform a series of subsequent operations, otherwise the message will be ignored.

⚠️ Note that the ARM64 version will prompt a file damage when opened because it needs Apple developer signature to start
normally. The author does not have an Apple developer certificate. However, you can still solve the problem through one
command:

- Move MessAuto.app to the `/Applications` folder.
- Execute `xattr -cr /Applications/MessAuto.app` in Terminal.

## TODO

- [x] Optimize CAPTCHA extraction rules
- [x] Customized Keywords
- [x] Add configuration options to the menu
- [ ] ~~Automatic deletion of extracted CAPTCHA text messages (no valid ideas)~~
- [x] In-App Updates
- [x] Github Action automated release
- [x] Add log
- [ ] Make App Home Page
- [x] Add email verification code detection function

## Motivation

macOS can conveniently receive short messages from the iPhone without having to open the phone to check the verification
code every time. Safari can even directly obtain the verification code and display it in the input box automatically.
However, this useful feature is only available in Safari, but not everyone likes to use it. In order to bring this
feature to all apps, I developed this app.

In the subsequent use, I also found that many verification codes are not only sent via SMS, but also via email, so I
added support for email.

## Requirements

- Use a **macOS system** and can receive **messages** from an iPhone.
- The Mail app needs to be resident in the background, otherwise the latest email cannot be obtained in real time.
- Full disk access permission (to access the `chat.db` file in `~/Library/Message.app` to get the latest message.)
- Accessibility permissions (simulates keyboard operations, auto paste and enter)

## Known issues

- Some apps or websites do not support Enter login and require manual clicking of login.

## Build

- `git clone https://github.com/LeeeSe/MessAuto.git`
- `cd MessAuto`
- `cargo install cargo-bundle`
- `cargo bundle --release`
